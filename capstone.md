# Introduction

## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (for example networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management efforts or service provider interaction.

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services over the internet. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centres and servers, you can access technology services as needed, from anywhere in the world.

 **Architecture represents the cloud computing**
